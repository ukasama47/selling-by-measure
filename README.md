# Customer Purchasing System

## Premise
- Apples and yogurt are sold by weight at the store.
- Apples: ¥1000 per kg
- Yogurt: ¥300 per kg, plus a container fee of ¥50 per customer.

## Procedure
1. The customer inputs the desired item ("apple" or "yogurt") and its weight (in kg) via the command line.
2. The program calculates and outputs the total amount.
3. This process continues in an infinite loop until the program execution is stopped by pressing Ctrl+C.
4. The program waits for new customer inputs from the command line.
